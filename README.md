This repository contains a Python function calculate_average with a bug and its solution. The function aims to compute the average of a list of numbers. However, it doesn't handle non-numeric input gracefully, leading to a TypeError. The bug.py file demonstrates this error, while bugSolution.py offers a corrected version that robustly addresses the issue by checking for non-numeric types and handling empty lists appropriately.
